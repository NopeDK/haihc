# Introduction

This implement support for IHC in Home Assistant. The soap interfacing to IHC is done in this library

https://github.com/dingusdk/PythonIhcSdk

It should be installed automatically by home assistant from the PyPi.


# How to use it

Place the files in the homeassistant configuration folder (the folder that contains your configuration yaml file) - so you have the "custom_components" folder as a sub folder to your HA configuration folder.

See the post on my blog for further description:
